# Astronomical Challange 
Our research focuses on classifying celestial objects into stars, galaxies or quasars using their spectral characteristics. With the advancement of astronomical technology, we can obtain a large amount of data, including images and spectral information, from telescopes and large-scale photometry.

The central question of our research is: "How can we effectively use image and spectral data to accurately classify different types of stellar objects?"
